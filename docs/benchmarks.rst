Benchmarks
==========

Reading and writing h5ad files
------------------------------

Of course, we want the associated notebook to be called "reading-writing.h5ad".

https://github.com/Koncopd/anndata-scanpy-benchmarks/blob/master/Benchmarks-Loading.ipynb

The notebook should also cover reading chunks.

https://github.com/Koncopd/anndata-scanpy-benchmarks/blob/master/chunk_X.ipynb

It should compare the results with loom.

We donâ€™t need images here, at this stage.


File sizes
----------

Another notebook should cover file sizes.
